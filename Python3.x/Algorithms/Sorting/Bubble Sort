Algorithm:

Given a list L of n elements with values or records L0, L1, …, Ln-1,
bubble sort is applied to sort the list L.
1. Compare first two elements L0, L1 in the list.
2. if L1 < L0, swap those elements and continue with next 2
elements.
3. Repeat the same step until whole the list is sorted, so no more
swaps are possible.
4. Return the final sorted list.


Complexity:

 О(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. .
